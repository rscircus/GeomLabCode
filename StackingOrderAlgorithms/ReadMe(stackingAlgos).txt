the drawing functions are temporary for now.. 
There is some work to be done with regards to that. The drawing for the PieCharts can't handle the large amount of Circles.
The inputs and outputs for the algorithms are always nested lists. For details look at the comments in the code.
I could also easily return a list of indices which indicate the permutation one needs to do on the original Data to get the results.

Maybe just try to use the highlevel functions (i.e the algorithms) for now and ignore the low level stuff.

If there are questions or some exceptions/bugs just contact me via slack..
